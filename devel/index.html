<p>The development started in April, 2009. The initial language concepts were 
changed several times since then. But today the conceptual work is almost&nbsp;done.</p>
<p>The prototype of compiler is under development.
This compiler is written in Java and uses <a href="http://llvm.org/"><span class="caps">LLVM</span></a> for executable
code&nbsp;generation.</p>
<p>All documented language features are implemented. The development is currently
focused on core libraries implementation, compiler stability, and implementation
of additional language features necessary to make libraries handy and&nbsp;efficient.</p>
<p>The next major step is a 0.3.0 release, which should contain the core libraries
and should be stable and practically&nbsp;usable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You may track the development activity <a href="https://bitbucket.org/o42a/o42a/commits/all">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="development-plan">Development&nbsp;Plan</h2>
<p>The development is planned to consist of two main&nbsp;phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>a prototype development,&nbsp;and</li>
<li>a production compiler development (since release&nbsp;0.5.0).</li>
</ul>
<p>The prototype will be written in Java and should become a bootstrap compiler
for the upcoming production compiler, which will be written in&nbsp;o42a.</p>
<p>A production compiler written in o42a is not just a get-rid-of-Java task.
The more important objective is to proof the language maturity and
its usefulness in a serious development. Well, the compiler is really is
a serious project and its development will be an excellent practice of the
language&nbsp;usage.</p>
<p>Because Java has a rich set of development tools it better suits for the
conceptual work, experimenting and refactoring. The production compiler written
in o42a will be a rewrite of a prototype one. Its development will start only
when the prototype compiler will be considered good enough in terms of feature
set, stability and&nbsp;performance.</p>
